## Welcome to the Radiotherapy Paediatric Atlas (RT-PAL) Project Page

RT-PAL are 3D images that make  a virtual model of an average paediatric patient developed for non-commercial research use.

The RT-PAL 2021 model was generated by merging computed tomography (CTs) from a population of paediatric radiotherapy patients. Full description of the methodology used for its synthesis is published elsewhere (Veiga et al, 2021).

The methodology was later further expanded to generate a series of age and sex-specific models - RT-PAL 2024 models (Ahmad et al, 2024).

The atlases serves as a common reference frame to spatially standardise this complex population, facilitating subsequent analysis of the population. It was developed with the aim of facilitating research into paediatric radiotherapy late effects. Examples of applications include identifying regions of the body more prone to radiation side-effects (voxel-based analysis), estimating out of field dosimetry, etc.
 
The atlas was built through a collaboration with University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
